# DC Metro Train Tracker

Python project to track the DC Metro (WMATA) in real time from your terminal —
rail stations and the lines they support, upcoming train arrivals, bus
predictions, service incidents, and elevator/escalator outages. The original
fun project now sits on a reusable WMATA API client.

## Setup

1. Get a free API key from WMATA: https://developer.wmata.com/
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste your key:

   ```
   WMATA_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Live web hub (the main event)

A browser dashboard you leave open to watch the system: a stylized diagram of
the colored line routes on a dark background with **train dots gliding along the
lines** in real time, an arrival board (click any station), and a service
incident ticker.

```
python hub/server.py
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000. Trains are placed by mapping each train's
reported **track circuit** onto the ordered circuit→station sequence from the
StandardRoutes API, interpolating its position between stations; the browser
smoothly eases each dot toward its next position so trains glide. Train data
refreshes every 10s, arrivals every 15s, incidents every 30s.

> The diagram is drawn from real station coordinates (abstract colored lines on
> dark grey — no map tiles). A hand-tuned schematic ("spider map" angles) is a
> possible future refinement.

### Command-line tools

**Original station list** (every station, supported lines, next 3 trains, refreshing every 20s):

```
python stationSchedule.py
```

**Terminal dashboard** (rail predictions + incidents + elevator/escalator outages, optional bus stop):

```
python dashboard.py
python dashboard.py --stations A01,C01,B01 --interval 15
python dashboard.py --bus-stop 1001195
```

## API client (`wmata.py`)

`WmataClient` wraps the WMATA **JSON REST** endpoints — use it to build your own
tools:

```python
from wmata import WmataClient

client = WmataClient()                 # reads WMATA_API_KEY from .env
trains = client.rail_predictions("A01")
buses = client.bus_predictions("1001195")
incidents = client.rail_incidents()
positions = client.train_positions()
```

Covered endpoint groups:

- **Rail Station Information** — lines, stations, station info, entrances, parking, times, path, fares (`station_to_station`)
- **Real-Time Rail Predictions** — `rail_predictions`
- **Train Positions** — `train_positions`, `standard_routes`, `track_circuits`
- **Bus Route and Stop Methods** — `bus_routes`, `bus_route_details`, `bus_route_schedule`, `bus_stops`, `bus_stop_schedule`, `bus_positions`
- **Real-Time Bus Predictions** — `bus_predictions`
- **Incidents** — `rail_incidents`, `bus_incidents`, `elevator_incidents`
- **Misc Methods** — call via the generic `client.get("/path", params)` passthrough

> GTFS / GTFS-RT (protobuf) feeds are not covered yet. The generic `get()` method
> can reach any other JSON endpoint not given a dedicated wrapper.

Minor error handling for stations under construction or other events that show no trains on their schedule.
