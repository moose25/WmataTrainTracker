# DC Metro Train Tracker
Python project for fun to show every DC Metro train station, the lines they support, and the upcomming trains/arrival times to those stations. The script refreshes the list every 20 seconds to stay up to date. 

The top section has the individual station name with the color lines that are supported at that station. 

The train lines contain the color code of the train, it's final destination/direction, and time to arrival at the station that is listed.
